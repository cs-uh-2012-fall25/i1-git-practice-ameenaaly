# Interesting points:
In this blog post, published by Carnegie Mellon University, titled _Will AI Make Software Engineers Obsolete? Hereâ€™s the Reality_, the author argues that while AI is revolutionizing the tech industry it cannot make Software Engineers obsolete. The argument is based on the belief that AI is not creative and does not have critical thinking skills. Therefore, humans will always remain the primary Software Engineering solution providers but can now use AI as a tool to help them. The blog post is calling people to take part in coding bootcamp offered by Carnegie Mellon University, 

The blog post article seems very biased to me and contradicting. If AI is good at helping an average person create viable solutions without being a coding expert, then AI will help reduce the need for Software Engineers because people will feel empowered by AI to tackle problems on their own. This is an apparent trend whose effects we are already seeing with vibe-coding. While I do not necessarily think that pure-vibe coding is a safe idea, I also don't believe that AI is not going to change any of the market for software engineers, otherwise, there wouldn't be a need to post such an article and convince people they could still benefit, and may even need, a coding bootcamp.
